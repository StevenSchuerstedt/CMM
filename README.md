# Computational Models of Motion
This repository contains all important documents of the CMM lecture at ETH Zurich in FS 21. 
In the exercise folder you can find all the slides used in the exercise session, as well as the six different exercise assignments. Each assignment contains the exercise sheet, as pdf or in the readme, and my actual solution. In some cases I also provided videos to show the behaviour of the final program, you might find that interesting. In some cases the readme file contains written solutions to some questions asked in the exercise sheet. 

For an overwiew of the class you might want to visit http://crl.ethz.ch/teaching/computational-motion-21/.
